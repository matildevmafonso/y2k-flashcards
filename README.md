## 💿 OVERVIEW

**FLASH_BATTLE 2K** is not your average study tool. It is a **retro-futuristic gamified flashcard app** that turns memorization into a high-score battle. 

Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, it features a rigorous "Battle Mode" where you maintain streaks, earn XP, and defeat "Bosses" (Classes) and "Target Points" (Topics) in a Windows 98-meets-Cyberpunk interface.
